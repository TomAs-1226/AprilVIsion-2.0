# Camera-to-robot extrinsic transform for Mac simulator
#
# This defines where the simulated camera is mounted on the robot:
# - Position is relative to robot center (meters)
# - Rotation is relative to robot forward direction (degrees)
#
# Default: Camera mounted at front of robot, 0.5m high, facing forward

# Position in robot frame (meters)
translation:
  x: 0.30    # Forward from robot center
  y: 0.0     # Left from robot center (0 = centered)
  z: 0.45    # Height from ground

# Rotation from robot frame (degrees)
# Roll: rotation around X (forward) axis
# Pitch: rotation around Y (left) axis - positive = looking down
# Yaw: rotation around Z (up) axis - positive = looking left
rotation:
  roll: 0.0
  pitch: 15.0   # Camera tilted down slightly to see floor tags
  yaw: 0.0      # Facing straight forward
